1 - Know Your Soil: The health of your plants starts with the soil. Make sure to test your soilâ€™s pH and nutrient levels. If your soil is too acidic or alkaline, adjust it using amendments like compost, lime, or sulfur. Healthy soil leads to stronger, more resilient plants.

2 - Water Deep, Not Often: Instead of light, frequent waterings, aim to water deeply and less frequently. This encourages plants to grow deep roots, which helps them access water and nutrients more efficiently. Try watering early in the morning to reduce evaporation.

3 - Companion Planting: Some plants grow better when placed together, either because they repel pests or enhance each other's growth. For example, planting basil near tomatoes can improve flavor and deter pests like mosquitoes and flies. Do some research to see which plants complement each other in your garden.
