London calling to the faraway towns
Now war is declared and battle come down
London calling to the underworld
Come out of the cupboard,you boys and girls

London calling, now don't lecture us
Phony Beatlemania has bitten the dust
London calling, see we ain't got no swing
Except for the reign of that truncheon thing

The ice age is coming, the sun's zooming in
Meltdown expected, the wheat is growing thin
Engines stop running, but I have no fear
'Cause London is drowning I live by the river

London calling to the imitation zone
Forget it, brother, you can go at it alone
London calling to the zombies of death
Quit holding out and draw another breath

London calling and I don't wanna shout
But while we were talking I saw you running out
London calling, see we ain't got no high
Except for that one with the yellowy eyes

The ice age is coming, the sun's zooming in
Engines stop running, the wheat is growing thin
A nuclear error, but I have no fear
'Cause London is drowning I, I live by the river

The ice age is coming, the sun's zooming in
Engines stop running, the wheat is growing thin
A nuclear error, but I have no fear
'Cause London is drowning I, I live by the river

Now get this
London calling, yes I was there too
An' you know what they said, well, some of it was true
London calling at the top of the dial
And after all this, won't you give me a smile?
London Calling
