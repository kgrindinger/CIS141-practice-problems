#3. In the game Pokemon, certain types of Pokemon do extra damage to other types.
#For example, water is very effective to fight fire.
#Write a function called type_advantage(attacker, defender) that takes two Pok√©mon types as
#strings and returns "Super Effective", "Not Very Effective", or "Neutral" based on
#simple type effectiveness rules. Your solution only needs to work for these three sets of input:

#I just want to write code for the print statements, which is super helpful because I know nothing about Pokeman!
